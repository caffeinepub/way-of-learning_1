  "summary": "The implementation addresses all three requirements (REQ-21, REQ-22, REQ-23). App.tsx uses TanStack Router's navigate() for role-based redirects, RoleSelectionModal.tsx implements 10-second timeout logic with error handling and retry functionality, and useQueries.ts includes proper query invalidation and refetching with debug logging. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
