# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a complete educational platform called "Way of Learning" with fully functional navigation, role-based dashboards (Teacher, Student, Parent, Admin), and core educational features including messaging, attendance tracking, assignments, quizzes, materials, discussions, and calendar.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement React Router navigation system with working tabs, buttons, and links across all dashboards
- Create Teacher Dashboard with navigation to Classes, Sessions, Assignments, Materials, Messaging, Discussions, and Calendar
- Create Student Dashboard with navigation to Classes, Grades, Attendance, Assignments, Quizzes, Materials, Messaging, Discussions, and Calendar
- Create Parent Dashboard with navigation to Children's Progress, Attendance, Grades, Messaging with Teachers, Discussions, and Calendar
- Create Admin Dashboard with navigation to User Management, Monitoring, System Analytics, and administrative features
- Implement messaging system between Teachers-Students and Teachers-Parents
- Implement attendance tracking where teachers mark attendance and students/parents view records
- Implement assignments management with creation, submission, and grading workflows
- Implement quizzes and assessments system
- Implement learning materials library for uploading and accessing study materials
- Implement discussion forums for class discussions
- Implement calendar and scheduling system displaying sessions, assignments, quizzes, and important dates
- Apply creative, coherent visual theme with distinct educational style (avoiding generic blue/purple schemes)
- Verify complete user flows for all four roles ensuring all features are accessible and functional

**User-visible outcome:** Users can authenticate with Internet Identity, access role-specific dashboards (Teacher, Student, Parent, or Admin), navigate seamlessly between all features, communicate via messaging, track attendance, manage assignments and quizzes, access learning materials, participate in discussions, and view a comprehensive calendar of educational activities in a professionally designed educational platform.
